
Castalia 3.2: Changes from 3.1
------------------------------------------
- Bug fixes: 
   -sleeping bug in 802.15.4 MAC
   -possible segfault in TimerService code
   -bugs with DESTROY_NODE and OUT_OF_ENERGY msgs
   -bug with NODE_STARTUP. Now the Radio and
    Resource Mgr receive and are affected by 
    the node startup msg
   -readRSSI was returning -197dBm when no signal
    was received. Now the noiseFloor is returned
   -error accumulating in rare cases due to 
    subtract_dBm(). Now this method is not used. 

- TunableMAC: changed the beacon TX to not leave
  gaps. Collect richer output

- Better structured and cleaned the Virtual app/
  rouring/MAC classes and associated generic packets.  

- VirtualApp: empty appID means no filtering of packets
 
- Added --title and --scale flags to CastaliaPlot, 
  added check for valid gnuplot executable

- Images (png, gif, jpg) produced with CastaliaPlot
  contain in the header metadata the full command
  that produced them.
 

Castalia 3.1: Changes from 3.0
------------------------------------------
- Introduction of CastaliaPlot to create graphs
  automatically based on CastaliaResults output

- Features added to CastaliaResults
  e.g., options --all --sum -v
 
- Enhanced Tunable MAC with CSMA persistence 
  options, and TX options

- Dublicate packets handled in virtual routing
  and virtual MAC modules

- Radio module enhanced to handle TXing without
  interruption
 
- Minor cleanup and bug fixes:
  Cleaned up throughput app,
  bugs in GTS 802.15.4MAC
  bug in multipathRings



Castalia 3.0: Major changes from 2.3
------------------------------------------
- Porting to OMNeT++ 4.x

- Major restructuring of input and output
  1) Standard way to create output and trace files
  2) Introduced Castalia script to assist in
     creating complex simulation scenarios without
     the need for custom scripting solutions 
  3) Introduced CastaliaResults script to assist
     in processing the output easily without the
     need for custom scripting solutions

- Created virtual classes for app, net, and MAC.
  New apps or protocols can be easily derived
  from these classes, which provide considerable
  abstraction tools and services.

- Independent service of timers to be used with 
  the app routing and MAC modules

- Complete redefinition of Radio module
  1) Radio receives signals from the channel.
     Reception/interference calculations done
     in radio now (instead of channel)
  2) More accurate interference calculation
     (dynamic intereference accounted not just max)
  3) Ability to calculate number of bit errors
     in a packet (not just 0/1)
  4) Multiple RX modes (with different power consumed,
     datarate, modulation) that can change dynamically
  5) Multiple sleep levels.
  6) Transition times and power easily defined
  7) Multiple carrier frequencies, than ca change dynamically
  8) RSSI calculation is modeled more accurately taking 
     into account the history of signals a radio experiences

- Implementation of the Baseline BAN MAC as described
  in the IEEE 802.15 Task Group 6 proposal.
 

Castalia 2.3: Changes from ver 2.2
------------------------------------------
- Implemented GTS mode in 802.15.4 MAC,
  fixed several bugs.
- TMAC enhanced to select mechanisms for TA
  extension and collision resolution
- Minor modifications in bridgeTestRun script
  added average energy consumption
- Batch script for running BAN simulations added


Castalia 2.2: Changes from ver 2.1
------------------------------------------
- Implementation of 802.15.4 MAC (CAP, beacon mode)
- added modulation types diffBPSK, diffQPSK
- throughtputTest application measuring latency
- throughtputTest app supporting multihop traffic
  with nextRecipient parameter
- Bug with TMAC sending many RTS packets fixed



Castalia 2.1: Changes from ver 2.0
------------------------------------------
- T-MAC fully tested and debugged
- S-MAC implemented as variant of T-MAC
- Replaced buffer implementations with std <queue>
- parsePRRMap() debugged and complete functionality
- Automated test suite implemented, look in Tests/
- 3 more parameters for sensing devices



Castalia 2.0: Major changes from ver 1.3
------------------------------------------

== Wireless channel module
1. Mobility support (!)
2. Time-varying links (!)
3. 3D coordinates and orientation
4. the 2 directions of a link correlated
   with a dedicated parameter

== Radio Module
1. Custom modulation allowed by defining
   a SNR->BER array. 
2. variance in TX power introduced. The radio
   now sends explicit TxPower to the channel,
   instead of a power level index.


== MAC module
1. TMAC implemented


== Application modules
1. Test throughput app introduced



Castalia 1.3: Changes from ver 1.2
------------------------------------------
- Implementation of 2 routing protocols
- Implementation of 2 new example applications (using routing protocols)
- Advanced ability to define various degrees of simpler channel and radio models
- Bug fixes with the TunableMAC and routing modules




Castalia 1.2: Changes from ver 1.1
------------------------------------------
- Creation of a network/routing module.
- Ability to modify several radio and MAC parameters 
  through the application code at run-time.
- Minor bug fixes relating with EV.
- Richer debug messages
  (awaiting for the visualization tool)



Castalia 1.1: Changes from ver 1.0
------------------------------------------
-Restructuring of the input (omnetpp.ini parameter file)
 to be more modular.
-Restructuring of the output to be clearer.
-Changes to the run scripts to accomodate the above changes.
-Minor bug fixes relating building problems under Cygwin.
